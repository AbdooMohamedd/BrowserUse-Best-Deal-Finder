# üîç BrowserUse Best Deal Finder

An AI-powered price comparison tool built with [Browser-Use](https://github.com/microsoft/browsing-assistant) and DeepSeek AI. Find the best deals across multiple e-commerce websites without the hassle of manual searching.

## What it does

BrowserUse Best Deal Finder is a powerful tool that automates the tedious process of searching for the best product deals across multiple e-commerce websites. It leverages the Browser-Use framework's AI agent capabilities to navigate websites, extract product information, and identify the best deals based on price.

The tool:

1. Takes a product name as input from the user
2. Automatically searches for it on configured e-commerce websites (Jumia, B.Tech, etc.)
3. Extracts detailed product information including name, price, image, URL, and availability
4. Sorts all results by price to identify the best deals
5. Presents the top 3 best deals in the console
6. Saves all product data in a structured JSON format for further processing

### Key Features

- **Automated Web Browsing**: Uses Browser-Use's AI agent to navigate e-commerce sites just like a human would
- **Multi-Website Comparison**: Searches across multiple e-commerce websites in parallel
- **Price-Based Ranking**: Identifies the best deals based on actual prices
- **Detailed Product Information**: Extracts product names, prices, images, URLs, descriptions and availability
- **Structured Data Output**: Saves all results to a clean JSON file for further processing or analysis
- **DeepSeek AI Integration**: Uses DeepSeek's powerful language model for web navigation and information extraction

## How It Works

The BrowserUse Best Deal Finder uses an AI-powered approach to automate product searching and price comparison:

1. **Browser Navigation**: Uses the Browser-Use framework's AI agent to open a browser and navigate to e-commerce websites
2. **Automated Searching**: Enters the user's product query into each website's search function
3. **Content Extraction**: Scrapes product details including names, prices, images and availability
4. **Deal Identification**: Sorts all products by price to find the best deals
5. **Results Processing**: Presents the top 3 products in the console and saves all data to JSON

## Technical Details
